# Given two strings comprised of + and -, return a new string which shows how the two strings interact in the following way:

# When positives and positives interact, they remain positive.
# When negatives and negatives interact, they remain negative.
# But when negatives and positives interact, they become neutral, and are shown as the number 0.The two strings will be the same length.

# neutralise("+-+", "+--") âžž "+-0"
# Compare the first characters of each string, then the next in turn.
